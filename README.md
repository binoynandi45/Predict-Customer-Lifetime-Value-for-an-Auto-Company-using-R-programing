Predict Customer Life-time Value for an Auto Insurance Company
Objective:-
1)	For an Auto Insurance company, predict the conditions effecting customer life time value (CLV). CLV is the total revenue the client will derive from their entire relationship with a customer. Because we don't know how long each customer relationship will be, we make a good estimate and state CLV as a periodic value — that is, we usually say “this customer's 12-month (or 24-month, etc) CLV is $x”.
  
1)	Understand the variables in the data set and study about the Industry.
